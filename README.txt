NOTE from Daniel: 
The following is (mostly) the original README of the mod and still refers to the SDK etc.

You can get the game data from http://www.gamefront.com/files/files/9003559/classic_doom_3_1.3.1.zip
Just extract that zip to your Doom3/dhewm3 installation.

After compiling the source, you can start the game with
  ./dhewm3 +set fs_game cdoom

Description
======================================================================

This is a package of all the files from the Doom 3 Software Development Kit (SDK) that have been modified in the creation of Classic Doom 3.  The more predominant features of this code are the following:

-The intermission/statistics screen displayed between levels (there is an unused key/val combination that would allow mappers to update the GUI graphics depending the sequential progress of the player.  This was originally designed to facilitate a map on the intermission screen, but was dropped).

-Autorun.  A very small modification that simply checks the state of ui_autoRun and accordingly either flips input from the run key or leaves it untouched.


For a complete picture of what has been changed, cross-reference this code and the untouched 1.3.1 code using diff or a similar program for your operating system.
